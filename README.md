# MMM-Provider-SOAP

This magic mirror module is a MMM-Provider module that will extract specified data from a SOAP feed and provide it to any requesting consumers in a defined JSON format.

The module can obtain data from a URL

## Usage

1) Specify the input source including base URL along with any API keys and parameters required
2) Specify field definitions that detail the data returned from the API call as well as any transformations for the output
3) Data can be sorted before being sent to the requesting consumer.

### Example

See MMM-MQTTRelay for an example of sending the British Rail Data to a MQ stream for consumption by an external client.

## Using the module

### MagicMirrorÂ² Configuration

To use this module, add the following minimum configuration block to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
```js
{
module: "MMM-Provider-SOAP",
			config: {
				consumerids: ["consumerid",],
				id: 'uniqueID', 
				package: 'packagename',
			}
},
```

Check out the example.config.js file for an example of a config that will produce an output of trains departing from a specific station for the MMM-Consumer-????? module

### Field definitions

	field definitions are in the format: (|entry is optional|)
	{fieldname:{|address:'dotnotation from the base|[]|'|,|inputtype:fieldtype|,|outputtype:fieldtype|,|key:true|,|outputname:''|,|sort:true|,|default:''|}}
		fieldname is  the  fieldname of the input field in the input data.
		address is optional, if not specified then the data is extracted from the base address level.  
		If suffixed by [] then it there is a secondary array of values of 0 or more entries. A record will be produced by looping through the secondary array and adding any non array fields from the main array. See the metoffice package for an example. 
		Currently only 1 subsequent level is supported and all fields with an secondary array address must have the same address. The secondary array must not be dot delimited in its name or address!!
		!!These fields must come after none array fields, otherwise the data send to the consumer will be incomplete at best and corrupted at worst!!

		fieldtype can be 'n', 's', 'b', 't','a'
			n = numeric, the input is validated as numeric (converted to string if needed), the output is numeric 
			s = string, the input is converted to string if not string for output
			b = boolean, the input is converted to true/false for output
			t = timestamp, the input is converted to a numeric unix format of time (equivalent of new Date(inputvalue).getTime()
				timestamp can include a format to help the conversion of the input to the output (see examples)
			d = time of day, in format hh:mm:ss or hh:mm - 24 hour clock, assumes UTC, any timezone adjustments should be made by the consuming module
			a = array, each entry within the array that starts at base + name will be stringified and then added to the output, no validation is carried out, it can only be input type, outputtype of "a" will be ignored
		key indicates that this field should be used for the subject entry within the output, if not specified then the first entry is the key, the key is the highest level to use if the data is sorted
		outputname is the name to use for the field in output, if not specified the fieldname is used
		sort indicates if this field should be included as a sort key, the sort order is always, key 1st and then any fields indicated as sort in the order they are entered in the fields array
		default can be used to provide the variable with a default value that can be used as if it is a literal for criteria validation 
		if no key is included and any field is flagged as sorting, even if first field, then the key field is also flagged as sort

### Example configuration

See example.config.js and the package BritishRailDeparturesReading.js in the packages folder for a configuration that will return train departure data for a station that is formatted to be relayed to MQTT through the MQTT relay consumer module

### Additional Notes

This is a WIP; changes are being made all the time to improve the compatibility across the modules. Please refresh this and the MMM-feedUtilities and MMM-ChartUtilities modules with a `git pull` in the relevant modules folders.

The entries in the package file take precedence over the config, to ensure the option in the config is used (such as the input option) then remove the entry from the package file.
